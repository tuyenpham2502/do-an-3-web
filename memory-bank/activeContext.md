# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Containerization and deployment infrastructure
- Zero-downtime deployment implementation
- Production-ready Docker setup

## Recent Changes
1. Added Docker configuration:
   - Dockerfile for multi-stage builds
   - docker-compose.yml for development
   - nginx.conf for production server
   - .dockerignore for build optimization

2. Implemented zero-downtime deployment:
   - Blue-green deployment pattern
   - Health check system
   - Nginx reverse proxy setup
   - Automatic rollback on failure

3. Created build.sh deployment script:
   - Container orchestration
   - Health verification
   - Traffic routing
   - Cleanup procedures
